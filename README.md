# Supporting Artifact for "Checking ùõø-Satisfiability of Reals with Integrals"
by Cody Rivera, Bishnu Bhusal, Rohit Chadha, A. Prasad Sistla,
and Mahesh Viswanathan.

Artifact by Cody Rivera and Bishnu Bhusal, Version 2.0, 2025.

This is the supporting artifact for "Checking ùõø-Satisfiability of Reals 
with Integrals", a paper which extends the framework of ùõø-decision procedures
to handle integrals of custom real-valued functions. We provide an implementation
of this extended decision procedure, ‚à´dReal. We also provide a benchmark suite 
written in ‚à´dReal's input language, as well as equivalent benchmarks in Wolfram
language or FairSquare's input language, where appropriate.

Please see `OVERVIEW.md` for a comprehensive overview of the artifact.
